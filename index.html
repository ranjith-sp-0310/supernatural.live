    <h1>Why We Fall for Those Who Don’t Fall for Us</h1>
    <p>Have you ever fallen for someone who didn’t feel the same way? You know it’s a bad idea, but you still hope. You replay their words in your head, searching for hidden meanings. A smile, a kind message, a little attention—it all feels like proof that maybe, just maybe, they care too.</p>
    <p>But deep down, you know the truth. They don’t see you the way you see them. And yet, you hold on, waiting, wondering, wishing.</p>
    <p>Why do we do this to ourselves? Why do we chase love that doesn’t chase us back? Let’s talk about it.</p>
    
    <h2>1. We Want What We Can’t Have</h2>
    <p>There’s something about wanting something just out of reach. The more unavailable someone is, the more desirable they seem.</p>
    <blockquote>“We don’t always love the person. Sometimes, we love the challenge.”</blockquote>
    
    <h2>2. Love Feels Like a Drug</h2>
    <p>When we fall for someone, our brain releases <span class="highlight">dopamine</span>, the same chemical that makes us feel good after eating chocolate or winning a game. Every little interaction—a text, a glance, a small compliment—gives us a hit of dopamine.</p>
    <blockquote>“Rejection doesn’t just hurt emotionally—it actually activates the same part of the brain as physical pain.”</blockquote>
    
    <h2>3. The Trap of False Hope</h2>
    <h3>A. The ‘What If’ Illusion</h3>
    <p>You think: <span class="highlight">"Maybe they’ll change their mind."</span> But if someone truly wanted you, they wouldn’t need convincing.</p>
    <blockquote>“If someone wants you, you’ll know. If they don’t, you’ll be confused.”</blockquote>
    
    <h3>B. Fear of Letting Go</h3>
    <p>Letting go feels like losing. It feels like admitting defeat. But here’s the thing: <span class="highlight">holding on to something that hurts isn’t strength—it’s self-sabotage.</span></p>
    <blockquote>“Sometimes, we hold on because it’s all we’ve known, not because it’s right for us.”</blockquote>
    
    <h3>C. The Movie Lie</h3>
    <p>We grew up watching love stories where the hero never gives up, and in the end, they win the girl (or guy). But in real life, <span class="highlight">chasing someone who doesn’t want you isn’t romantic—it’s painful.</span></p>
    <blockquote>“Love should feel like home, not like a battlefield.”</blockquote>
    
    <h2>What Now?</h2>
    <p>Unrequited love drains you. It makes you feel like you’re not enough. But the truth is, <span class="highlight">you are enough—it’s just the wrong person.</span></p>
    <p>At some point, you have to ask yourself: <span class="highlight">"Am I holding on because I believe they’ll change, or because I’m scared to move on?"</span></p>
    <blockquote>“Love that is real will never make you feel unwanted.”</blockquote>
    <p>Moving on isn’t easy, but staying stuck is worse. The moment you let go, you make room for the love you actually deserve.</p>
    <p>And trust me, <span class="highlight">you deserve better.</span></p>
